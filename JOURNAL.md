## 11/5/2025 - Researched ideas and planned functionality  

I took some notes after researching ideas and parts as well as planning the functionality. 

I plan on using OnShape to model it in the future updates

It was relatively easy to find information and help on the project and it hopefully wont be too complicated to model and plan!

Attatched screenshot of my notes app because I dont have any preview images or anything yet.![Screenshot 2025-11-05 at 7.23.26 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--66a7bd57ec77077d3264fcf43e05635ab8cf7b0f/Screenshot%202025-11-05%20at%207.23.26%E2%80%AFPM.png)
  

## 11/6/2025 - Modeled a basic faceplate for the chassis  

I used onshape to model a faceplate to use with cutouts for the different parts (Screen, RFID, Fingerprint, and Keypad) and plan to 3D print it when I am assembling it.

It was pretty difficult to learn onshape as I have not really used a CAD software before, but it wasn't too complicated once I got the hang of it. I want to try to fit all the parts I plan to use with Onshape's public 3d model library.
