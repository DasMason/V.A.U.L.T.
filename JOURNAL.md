## 11/5/2025 - Researched ideas and planned functionality  

I took some notes after researching ideas and parts as well as planning the functionality. 

I plan on using OnShape to model it in the future updates

It was relatively easy to find information and help on the project and it hopefully wont be too complicated to model and plan!

Attatched screenshot of my notes app because I dont have any preview images or anything yet.![Screenshot 2025-11-05 at 7.23.26 PM](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--66a7bd57ec77077d3264fcf43e05635ab8cf7b0f/Screenshot%202025-11-05%20at%207.23.26%E2%80%AFPM.png)
